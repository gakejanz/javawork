This program was written on Ubuntu and should be ran on Ubuntu.

Running the main class of this package will bring the UI to the user to interact with.
Much of the pieces for this program are explained in detail in the javadoc comments so
there will not be too much detail here.

The UI features an over-arching Settings Menu that functions the same as in HW02.
The bottom part of the UI updates the Scores, displays times, and allows the user to control movement.

One thing I would like to add here, is that in order to end the program, the users must simply exit out of the program. There is no exit command.
That being said the server must also be ended by hard stopping the execution of the program. In a console just type Contol + C.

In order to connect two laptops. The host must share their ipv4 address with the client, and the client must enter this to connect.

In order to run this program, one must extract from the zip file to their desktop and open the terminal. From there they must enter four commands:
cd Desktop
cd Homework3
sh Battleship_Run.sh

After closing the application, if the user has a saved myPreferences.txt file in the file directory (where it will automatically be saved) these settings will load on start up.

Attached in this folder is a simple manual, and a test cases file.
This Battleship_Docs folder holds all html javadoc files.
