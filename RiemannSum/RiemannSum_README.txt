This program was writtenon Ubuntu and should be run on Ubuntu.

The Riemann Sum program takes inputs from users, in which they choose functions and Riemann sum types from a predetermined list, as well as some limits, an interval and precision. These inputs are filtered through a large decision statement, and then the result of the selected Riemann sum is printed out.

In order to run this program, one must extract from the zip file to their desktop and open the terminal. From there they must enter four commands:
cd Desktop
cd HW01_JacobGanz
cd RiemannSum
sh RiemannSumRun.sh

This program will run in the terminal.
It will ask the user to enter some number inputs that are validated to ensure they will not break the program. 

The RiemannSumDocs folder contains all the javadoc files for this program.
